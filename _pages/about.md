I am a thrid-year undergradate student at ACM Honoured Class, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](en.sjtu.edu.cn). Currently, I am a member of [Apex Data and Knowledge Management Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Porf.Yong Yu and Prof. Weinan Zhang. I am working on projects about multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I am highly interested in building various computer systems and deep reinforcement learning.
